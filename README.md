# odin-recipes

This project was a compilation of a few recipes that I enjoyed and that I was able to put into a basic website. I demonstrated the ability to create a basic HTML file using the HTML boilerplate, add links and images, create ordered and unordered lists, and create paragraphs and headings within the body of the HTML file. I was also able to do these things not just on their own, but within other skills, such as creating a list of the links and linking a recipe within another recipe.

On top of the skills listed above, I also demonstrated the ability to use git and GitHub to save and upload my work using version control software.
