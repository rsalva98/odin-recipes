        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is perfect if, like my husband, you can't stand ketchup smothered over the top of your perfectly good meatloaf. Instead, this will give you a perfectly juicy meatloaf with a delicious brown gravy to put over the top.</p>
        <p>This recipe is a family favorite, with everyone from the youngest to the oldest enjoying it.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 lbs ground beef</li>
            <li>1 tbs olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup diced onions</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbs chopped garlic</li>
            <li>1 tbs fresh thyme, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tbs tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tbs Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>3/4 cup breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li><a href="../recipes/brown-gravy.html">Brown Gravy</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
            <li>Add the oil to a skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the onions, salt, and pepper and cook for 7-8 minutes until slightly carmelized and softened.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, stir and cook for a minute longer, then pour in the chicken broth and stir.Let the chicken broth reduce for 1 minute and then turn the heat off and remove the skillet from the burner to cool.</li>
            <li>To a large bowl, add the ground beef along with the eggs and breadcrumbs. Once the onion mixture has cooled, add it to the bowl with the meat and mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray. Form the meat into a loaf shape and place in the oven.</li>
            <li>Cook the meatloaf for 50-55 minutes. Check the meatloaf after 50 minutes to see if it's cooked through. This will depend on the size and shape you made your meatloaf.</li>
            <li>While the meatloaf is in the oven, you can make the brown gravy. When the meatloaf comes out of the oven, pour the gravy over the top of the meatloaf or slice the meatloaf and serve the gravy on the side.</li>
        </ol>
